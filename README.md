## 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithms Used

### 1️⃣ Linear Regression
- Used for **predicting continuous values**  
- Assumes a linear relationship between input features and output  
- Example use case: Predicting exam marks  

### 2️⃣ Logistic Regression
- Used for **binary classification**  
- Output is categorical (Pass / Fail)  
- Uses the **Sigmoid function**  

### 3️⃣ Random Forest Regression
- Ensemble learning technique  
- Utilizes multiple decision trees  
- Reduces overfitting and improves prediction accuracy
