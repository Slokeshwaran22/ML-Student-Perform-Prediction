# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting student performance using different **Machine Learning algorithms**.  
The goal is to analyze how various models perform and to compare their accuracy and error metrics.

We use:
- **Linear Regression** – for continuous value prediction
- **Logistic Regression** – for classification
- **Random Forest Regression** – for improved accuracy using ensemble learning

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the dataset and preprocess it
- Apply multiple ML algorithms
- Compare model performance
- Predict student performance accurately

## 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithms Used

### 1️⃣ Linear Regression
- Used for **predicting continuous values**
- Assumes a linear relationship between input features and output
- Example use case: Predicting exam marks

### 2️⃣ Logistic Regression
- Used for **binary classification**
- Output is categorical (Pass / Fail)
- Uses the **Sigmoid function**

### 3️⃣ Random Forest Regression
- Ensemble learning method
- Uses multiple decision trees
- Reduces overfitting and improves accuracy
